Description: This project mainly does a few things, including:
 1) Finding urls with correct format 
 2) cache data with umsi directory and tweets with certain keywords

Things to Note for Part One:
       1) finding urls: I did as the proj described
       2) the difference between "()" and "[]" is interesting

Things to note for Part Two:
       1) the default page is "page = 0"
       2) the last page to add is "page = 11" 
       3) total is 12 pages

Things to note for Part Three:
       1) wasnt quite true about what is required until the end
       2) the tweets change often so it is hard to check the correct answers...
